In a rare public presentation, Glencore's Australia-based head of global coal assets, Peter Freyberg, insisted coal was \u201ca very, very important part\" of the company, and that executives were considering options to acquire new assets or tie up with other producers with an eye to the long-term. When Glencore closed its purchase of fellow miner Xstrata PLC two years ago, Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg said the blockbuster deal was \u201ca big play on coal.\" Since then, coal prices have fallen sharply, while Glencore's market value has dropped close to its lowest level since it floated in London and Hong Kong in 2011.

MasterCard is linking up with Somalia's Premier Bank and has already distributed its first credit cards to Somalis, after a three-year process to set up shop in the strife-torn nation in the Horn of Africa, said Daniel Monehin, division president for sub-Saharan Africa said. The move signals Mastercard's willingness to undertake risks in Africa, even going into the continent's most dangerous corners ahead of its key competitor, Visa. It also heralds a first step in lifting the effective financial blockade of Somalia. ",

In 2009 Aaron Regent, who shortly after became chief executive of Barrick Gold, said the world had reached \u201cpeak gold.\" Three years later, Mr. Regent was out of a job and mined gold output was still rising. Indeed, it hit a record 3,133 metric tons last year. Yet predictions of peak gold are again in vogue. It remains doubtful, however, that this heralds much elevation . Gold production may be plateauing: precious metals consultancy Metals Focus expects a slight fall in output this year. A decadelong rise in the gold price from 2001 fueled indiscriminate investment but miners have slashed spending since 2013. Substantial new mines, like Barrick's Pascua Lama in Chile, have been halted and exploration efforts scaled back. ",

Making his first start in a month, Gee lasted just four innings Wednesday night, surrendering seven runs (four earned) on eight hits in the Mets' 7-3 loss to the Padres. Gee, who landed on the disabled list on May 8 with a strained groin, snapped a streak of 51 consecutive starts completing at least five frames, a franchise record. Instead of removing somebody from the staff to accommodate Gee's return, the Mets simply added him into the mix as part of a continued effort to limit the workloads of some of their younger pitchers. In theory, it sounds like a fine plan: Keeping Gee around will shave innings off the ledgers of Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard, allowing them all to remain active for a potential playoff run.

But this time, it is for a capitalist endeavor: a 172-mile canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific. Nicaragua's planned route between the oceans could accommodate vessels more than four football fields long, too big even for the newly expanded Panama Canal. It would be the largest earth-moving project in history, according to Hong Kong Nicaragua Canal Development, or HKND Group, which has a 50-year concession to build and operate the canal. But to make room for the waterway, ports, roads and free-trade zones, the company says it needs 642 square miles. Nicaraguan government officials justify the pending expropriations, which would uproot 27,000 people, saying the canal will transform this impoverished Central American nation by creating 50,000 jobs and doubling the economy.

The Financial Conduct Authority, which is expect to hand down the fine on Friday, probed how the bank managed third-party groups who were hired to deal with complaints from customers sold , according to regulatory filings. PPI was widely sold alongside an assortment of financial products, including loans and credit cards, to cover customers' repayments should they fall sick or lose their job. Since 2000 Lloyds sold an estimated 16 million such policies. The bank estimates it has settled around 45% of the polices sold since then, according to its annual report. So far the bank has set aside more than \u00a312 billion to compensate customers. In 2013 the U.K. regulator fined the bank for delaying compensation payments for people sold PPI. Friday's fine is large in part because of the sheer number of mishandled complaints, according to one person familiar with the matter. ",

Economists had been expecting retail sales to climb by 0.3% from March following the previous month's 0.2% increase, but instead sales were flat in April. The disappointing data drove the Australian dollar down by more than half a U.S. cent as traders bet on the rising prospect of a further rate cut to shore up the ailing economy. Australia's benchmark stock index fell. The central bank has  to help the county transition away from a decadelong mining-investment boom . For the past few years, its policy makers have been hoping for other sectors, including retailing, construction and manufacturing, to pick up the slack. There have been two rate cuts already this year. ",

The preliminary findings released by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration point to a possible cause of the May 19 spill that blackened popular beaches with crude oil and created a 9-mile slick in the Pacific Ocean. The agency said investigators found that corrosion at the break site had degraded the pipe wall thickness to 1/16 of an inch. Additionally, the report noted that the area that failed was close to three repairs that had been made to the pipeline because of corrosion after 2012 inspections. ",

The tax program, known as 421-a, has previously drawn the scrutiny of an ethics panel because it gives lucrative benefits to developers, who also are among the state's more generous political contributors. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, along with legislators, disagree on how to change the program so discussions are under way to extend it temporarily and convene a special legislative session in several months\u2014or address it next year, according to people familiar with the negotiations.

Mr. Chafee formally announced his candidacy in a speech at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., Wednesday evening, where he made the case for his long-shot 2016 bid by embracing a hodgepodge of international and domestic issues supported by many progressives in the Democratic Party. His presence in the race presents Mrs. Clinton with another challenger from the left. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley contend Mrs. Clinton is out of step with her party on economic policy. Mr. Chafee argued the same on foreign affairs, making an issue of her 2002 vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq. ",

The bank moved the rate, known as the Selic, to 13.75% from 13.25%. The bank's goal is to slow the 12-month inflation rate to 4.5% by the end of 2016, from 8.2% in April. The decision by the central bank's policy makers was unanimous. The bank kept the wording of the announcement unchanged from the previous meeting, suggesting its monetary policy committee members want to leave open the option for more rate increases. ",

Medicare has since revised its methodology to include additional payments made to providers, and re-released 2012 billing data in June 2015. For this reason, the total payment figures cited in stories published prior to June 2015 may differ from figures cited from June 2015 onward. The original data released can be seen , and updated figures for 2012, along with 2013 billing data, can be seen . A fast-growing Virginia laboratory has collected hundreds of millions of dollars from Medicare while using a strategy that is now under regulatory scrutiny: It paid doctors who sent it patients' blood for testing. Health Diagnostic Laboratory Inc. transformed itself from a startup incorporated in late 2008 into a major lab with $383 million in 2013 revenues, 41% of that from Medicare. ",
